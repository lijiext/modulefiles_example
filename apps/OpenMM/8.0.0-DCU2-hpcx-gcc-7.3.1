#%Module1.0
module-whatis   "OpenMM is a toolkit for molecular simulation. It can be used either as a 
		 stand-alone application for running simulations, or as a library you call 
		 from your own code. It provides a combination of extreme flexibility (through 
		 custom forces and integrators), openness, and high performance (especially on 
		 recent GPUs) that make it truly unique among simulation codes.
		 version: 8.0.0 with DCU2

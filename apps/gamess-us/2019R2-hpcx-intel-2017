#%Module1.0
module-whatis   "GAMESS (General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure System) is computer software 
		 for computational chemistry program. It can perform several general computational chemistry 
		 calculations, including Hartree-Fock method, density functional theory (DFT), generalized 
		 valence bond (GVB), and multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF). Correlation 
		 corrections after these SCF calculations can be estimated by configuration interaction (CI), 
		 second order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), and coupled cluster (CC) theory.

#%Module1.0
module-whatis   "SU2 is a suite of open-source software tools written in C++ for the numerical 
		 solution of partial differential equations (PDE) and performing PDE constrained 
		 optimization.  The primary applications are computational fluid dynamics and 
		 aerodynamic shape optimization, but has been extended to treat more general 
		 equations such as electrodynamics and chemically reacting flows.

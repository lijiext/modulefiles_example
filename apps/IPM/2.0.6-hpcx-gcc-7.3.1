#%Module1.0
module-whatis   "IPM is a portable profiling infrastructure for parallel codes. It provides a 
		 low-overhead profile of application performance and resource utilization in a 
		 parallel program. Communication, computation, and IO are the primary focus. 
		 While the design scope targets production computing in HPC centers, IPM has 
		 found use in application development, performance debugging and parallel computing 
		 education. The level of detail is selectable at runtime and presented through a 
		 variety of text and web reports.

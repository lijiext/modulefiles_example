#%Module1.0
module-whatis   "CalculiX is a package designed to solve field problems. The method used is the finite element method.
		 With CalculiX Finite Element Models can be built, calculated and post-processed. The pre- and post-processor 
		 is an interactive 3D-tool using the openGL API. The solver is able to do linear and non-linear calculations. 
		 Static, dynamic and thermal solutions are available. Both programs can be used independently. Because the 
		 solver makes use of the abaqus input format it is possible to use commercial pre-processors as well. In turn 
		 the pre-processor is able to write mesh related data for nastran, abaqus, ansys, code-aster and for the free-cfd 
		 codes dolfyn, duns, ISAAC and OpenFOAM. A simple step reader is included. 
		 In addition external CAD interfaces are available.

module-whatis	"QMCPACK is an open-source production-level many-body ab initio Quantum 
		 Monte Carlo code for computing the electronic structure of atoms, molecules, 
		 2D nanomaterials and solids. The solid-state capabilities include metallic 
		 systems as well as insulators. QMCPACK is expected to run well on workstations 
		 through to the latest generation supercomputers. Besides high performance, 
		 particular emphasis is placed on code quality and reproducibility.

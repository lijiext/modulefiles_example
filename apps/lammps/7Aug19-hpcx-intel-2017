#%Module1.0
module-whatis   "LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics code, and an acronym for Large-scale Atomic/Molecular 
		 Massively Parallel Simulator. LAMMPS has potentials for solid-state materials (metals, semiconductors) 
		 and soft matter (biomolecules, polymers) and coarse-grained or mesoscopic systems. It can be used 
		 to model atoms or, more generically, as a parallel particle simulator at the atomic, meso, or 
		 continuum scale. LAMMPS runs on single processors or in parallel using message-passing techniques 
		 and a spatial-decomposition of the simulation domain. The code is designed to be easy to modify 
		 or extend with new functionality.

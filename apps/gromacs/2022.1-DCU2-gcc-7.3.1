#%Module1.0
module-whatis   "GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the 
                 Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles.
                 It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids and nucleic 
                 acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is 
                 extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate 
                 simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems.

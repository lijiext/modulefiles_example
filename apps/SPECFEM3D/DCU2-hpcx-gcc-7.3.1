##%Module1.0
module-whatis   "SPECFEM3D Cartesian simulates acoustic (fluid), elastic (solid), coupled acoustic/elastic, 
		 poroelastic or seismic wave propagation in any type of conforming mesh of hexahedra (structured 
		 or not.) It can, for instance, model seismic waves propagating in sedimentary basins or any 
		 other regional geological model following earthquakes. It can also be used for non-destructive 
		 testing or for ocean acoustics.

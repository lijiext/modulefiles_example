#%Module1.0
module-whatis   "GNU parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one or more computers. 
                 A job can be a single command or a small script that has to be run for each of the lines 
                 in the input. The typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of users, 
                 a list of URLs, or a list of tables. A job can also be a command that reads from a pipe. 
                 GNU parallel can then split the input and pipe it into commands in parallel.
